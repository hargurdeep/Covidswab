# Manufacturing NP swabs

Large-scale virological testing for SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of COVID-19, has resulted in an acute shortage in NP swabs across the United States. Ad hoc groups from academia and industry have formed to address this crisis. **This repository organizes output from these efforts**.

The purpose is to **update medical professionals and manufacturers**.

Note the location of the repo has changed.

**Several groups have been testing** various materials and geometries using various protocols. Details:

[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) <i>**Udated April 3**</i>](BIDMC/) | [University of Southern Florida (USF)](USF/) | [University of Washington (UW)](UW/) | [Stanford University](Stanford/) | United States Army

For those with in-house 3D printing capacity who are in the direst need, USF has graciously made an <a href="https://usf.box.com/s/wxmlj0r66vp8bzei6o7sur1kq1jr8o1i">STL file available, along with instructions that you should read first</a>. **However, <u>we strongly caution that NP swabs are a serious undertaking that can carry risk to patients if not carefully evaluated, by professionals, at multiple steps of development and use (e.g. design, materials)</u>, as the groups listed here have been doing. If you can work with a known manufacturer, you are strongly encouraged to do so instead of printing your own swabs.**

**All readers** are reminded that swabs are an FDA Class 1 exempt medical device not suitable for "garage testing." ENT, ER, and ID personnel do not need more work removing foreign bodies from/repairing damage to/treating infections in nasal cavities.

At this point **we discourage randomly printing/testing STL files**; instead please see results from testing sites above (esp. [USF](/USF), if you have your own printing capacity).

The content here is **not medical advice.**

Progress has been possible only because of the **extraordinary openness and sharing** of everyone involved, an inspirational and selfless victory over ego and related temptations.

As we move closer to large-scale manufacturing, contracts, etc. participants are asked to **involve their respective communications offices** before using each others' names in any promotional materials.

We are driven by a **single, common goal: stopping this pandemic.**

Anything is this repo is provided **[freely and openly](Participant_Agreement/)** in the spirit of cooperation for the free use for all.
