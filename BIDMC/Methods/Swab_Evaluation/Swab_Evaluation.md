## Methods:


### Physical evaluation:

Test swabs were examined by two infectious disease physicians. Samples were compared against standard clinical use nasal pharyngeal  swabs [Copan] and evaluated for the degree of overall stiffness/elasticity, tip head diameter, and break off points. Specific evaluations are as follows in no particular order.


1: The tip head was evaluated on whether it could easily and repeatedly be folded back upon itself and return to the normal axis of the swab.

2: The degree of flexibility  as well as the diameter of the tip head was evaluated based on the presumed difficulty of inserting it into the posterior nasopharynx.

3: The swab neck was evaluated based on the degree of flexibility and on the presumed efficacy of insertion into the posterior nasopharynx.

4: Placement and efficacy of break points for placement into vial. Upon consultation, swabs were scored on a pass-fail system based on their over performance.

### Gram Stain:
Prototypes were used for a cheek swab and subsequently smeared onto microscopy slides. Slides were then treated according to the BD BBL gram stain test kit protocol and examined at 10x-40x magnification in comparison to Copan swabs. Qualitatively, prototype swabs were passed if slides had a non-negligible, as compared to negative controls, quantity of bacteria. [1]

The specifics of this protocol are as follows:

Cheek swabs were performed before the swab tips were applied to microscopy plates, producing a smear. Smears were then flooded with Gram Crystal Violet for 1 minute and subsequently rinsed with cold water. Next, slides were flooded with Gram Iodine or Stabilized Gram Iodine for 1 minute before rinsing with cold water.  Color was next removed from slides with Gram Decolorizer for up to a minute before again rinsing slides with cold water. Counterstain (Gram Safranin or Gram Basic Fuchsin)  was then flooded onto slides for up to one minute and then rinsed with cold water. After air drying, slides were examined at 10x-40x magnification.

### PCR testing:
Unused test swabs were placed in 3mL aliquots of modified CDC viral transport media composed 500mL Hank's balanced salt solution, 10mL of heat inactivated FBS, 100μg/mL Gentamycin, 0.5μg/mL Fungizone, and 10mg/L Phenol red [2]. Samples next underwent SARS-CoV-2  real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on an Abbott M2000 automated platform [3].  Materials that affected the negative and positive controls of the of the rRT-PCR reactions, specifically altering the binding of internal control primers, were failed and vice versa.

The procedure is briefly described as follows.

0.5 mL samples are automatically using Abbott mSample Preparation SystemDNA, which relies on magnetic microparticle-based reagents to dissociate and capture Sars-Cov-2  virions before loading onto a 96 deep well plate.  Samples are then spiked with an unassociated RNA spike, which serves as an internal, positive control (IC). A master mix of SARS-CoV-2 Oligonucleoide Reagent, Thermostable rTth Polymerase Enzyme, activation reagent, and samples are added to the 96 well plate before amplification.

Target RNA is converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase prior to SARS-CoV-2 and IC primers anneal and are elongated. Thermal cycling then allows for dissociation of the cDNA:RNA  bond at high temperatures  before RNA primers bind the cDNA and are elongated at lower temperatures. In total, SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, SARS-CoV-2 N, and IC are amplified.

Abbott m2000rt read cycles are based on real-time fluorescence detection of annealed primers at low temperatures. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 primers have fluorescent moiety covalently bound to the 5' end, and a quencher moiety attached end, allowing for fluorescent detection only when the probe is bound to the target. The IC probe has a similar design, but with a different fluorophore.
