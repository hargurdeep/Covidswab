Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has graciously offered to test swabs for mechanical and absorption testing.

Please contact Angela Tooker at tooker1@llnl.gov

There are suggested mechanical and absorption testing files in this folder as well.

Anecdotally, the recommended max-torque at which point a clinicial would stop rotating a swab was estimated to be 3lbf-in, and the max pull-out force (e.g. for tensile tests) was estimated as between 1 and 5lbs.
